Problem Statement
Predict how many people will come to a park on a particular day, given the environmental information.

Approach:

Followed the below framework:

1) Data understanding
There are in total 18 variables - 17 independant and 1 dependant variable. The training set had 114,540 records
All the variables were numeric. Some of them are - Average Breeze speed, Min moisture in park, Location type

2) Data Preparation
Blank / Null value treatment: 
  a) There is about 30% Blank values in variables relating to pressure and pollution. So imputed the same with the empirical distribution      of the not null values
  b) There are about 0.03% Blank values in variables relating to Moisture. So, imputed the same with the variable's median value

3) Modelling
Have used Linear Regression modelling to predict the footfall.
Have used a lag variable which indicates the footfall on the previous day.

4) Evaluation
I have calculated the RMSE values between te actual and the predicted footfall.

Learnings:
1) Use R for predictive analytics use cases
2) Previous day's footfall can influence today's footfall, thereby can be used in the prediction model (Lag variable)
